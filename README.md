## Context
We are using a monorepo, meaning we store both the client and the server in the same repository. 

## Instructions:
In order to run the app, do the following steps:
1. Open a new terminal, then cd client, then npm i to install all client dependencies, then npm start 
2. Open a new terminal, then cd server, then npm i to install all server dependencies, then run npm to start server instance
3. Open a new terminal to use git while the first two terminals are running the client and server apps

## Git workflow:
1. Since you can't push straight to master, you have to create your own branch and write code on it, push it and make a pull request, have at least one person approves it, then you can merge to master
